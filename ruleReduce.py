'''into the reducer we get a list of entries in one of two formats:
    a,b\t2

    OR

    a,b\ta,b,c.1
    a,b\ta,b,d.1
    ....

the first type is the frequency of that pattern in the corpus
the second type's value is the frequency of that VALUE's pattern in the corpus

since both types make it to the reducer we can take a,b\t2 AND a,b\ta,b,c.1 to get:
a,b IMPLIES a,b,c .5
in other words a,b => c 50%
